The GroundCheck game object is like a small sensor
attached at the bottom of Robo's feet that checks 
whether the ground is being touched or not.

grounded = Physics2D.OverlapCircle(groundCheck.position, groundRadius, whatIsGround);
        //if grounded is true we're on the ground, if not we're not. This is being check every frame
        anim.SetBool("Ground", grounded);

The layer mask checks if colliding on objects for 
specific layers only.

- Transforms are used to get positions and other stuff of a game object
- groundCheck.position is the center of the OverlapCircle
- Radius is 0.2f
- Remember this script belongs to Robo. It's checking if Robo is colliding with this
circle.
- Is it checking if Robo and tile are colliding within the circle?
//////////////
Ok, so the GroundCheck itself is creating a tiny circle. This game object belongs to Robo
so it follows the player around. If the GroundCheck is colliding with an object within
the layer mask then it is set to true.
The circle doesn't belong to Ground check, but is rather made where its position is.
