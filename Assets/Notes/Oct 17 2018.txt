Today's goal:
 Keep smooth camera movement, but make camera go faster when falling.

Player game object is created when becoming a host, but for some
reason is invisible


Camera needs to follow the player's own Robo only

void OnCollisionEnter(collision col)
{
 if (col.gameObject.layers == fireup)
{
 fireupIncrease();
}
