Today's Goal:
 Pressing the PLAY button changes the scene to a level.
 First through click input, next through touch.

Tomorrow's Goal:
 Now that I know how to have on-screen buttons receive touch input, 
add movement (left, right and jump) buttons with placeholders (large
red squares with black outlines approximating the size of the real 
buttons). Movement and jumping should be possible on mobile.

PLAY has a script that says when this sprite is touched/clicked
the game begins.

GameObject >> UI >> Canvas
GameObject >> UI >> Button?

alt click on PC for anchor presets... Do my buttons needs to be 
anchored on screen?

Canvas size width 1001
Button at 500.5?

====================
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public void LoadByIndex (int sceneIndex)
{
	SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneIndex);
	//load scene inputted into function
	//This script is dragged into the On Click
	//inside the Button Script

======================
When the left button is clicked/touched, Robo needs to move left
- Set Robo's move to -1 when tapped, 0 when released?

How to change horizontal axis button to an on screen button?


=====================
When the mouse is clicked, mouseClicked = true
(under updating, check every frame)

When the pointer is down, set right bool to true and left to false
and vice versa

When mouse is hovering over a button, if mouseClicked = true,
set that functionality (pointerEnter)
