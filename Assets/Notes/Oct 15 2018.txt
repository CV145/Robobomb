Goal: Make the powerups. Picking up a fireup increases 
explosion scale and a bombup increases bomb limit. There
could be a total of 5 levels. Set up a UI on the canvas, 
placeholder, that shows current fire and bomb levels.
- Finish BlackDynamite then. After, quiz 
Also, have a brief delay when throwing bombs to warn and
stop player from running into their own explosions.

Tomorrow 10/16: Finish anything not finished today. Add a
breakable block that drops powerups.
