Size 35
Ref. 192x192

---
SDD tile sizes are 16x16
Outline for a tile was H147.7, S32.5, V15.7. Have outlines be 
somewhere around this color.

Should Robo be 25x16 instead?
- Either a high saturation or a high value on main char
Outline S87.5, V 15.7

Tiles
S 54.4
V 67.1
Around the midrange. Not too saturated like Robo (most important 
sprite) but not unsaturated like backgrounds(things
with no collision etc). Some details in foreground are as 
saturated as robo
