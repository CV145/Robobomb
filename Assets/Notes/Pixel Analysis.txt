Size 35
Ref. 192x192

---
SDD tile sizes are 16x16
Outline for a tile was H147.7, S32.5, V15.7. Have outlines be 
somewhere around this color.

Should Robo be 25x16 instead?
- Either a high saturation or a high value on main char
Outline S87.5, V 15.7

Tiles
S 54.4
V 67.1
Around the midrange. Not too saturated like Robo (most important 
sprite) but not unsaturated like backgrounds(things
with no collision etc). Some details in foreground are as 
saturated as robo

The color is a pure white standing out from the rest. It is
light on detail and not too obstrusive. Located right at the very
edge of the screen.

Side notes:
- Canvas reference resolution is 800x800, scaling with screen size 
- Reference pixels per... is 1
- Pixel perfect check

The button is multiplied by 4. For some reason its original size is
too small.
