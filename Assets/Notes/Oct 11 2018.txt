Today's goal: Pressing either z or x changes Robo's animation to 
READY. Once they're let go of Robo changes to FIRE. Have a new
bomb game object spawn in front of Robo and fall to the ground
using gravity (more physics can be added later)
- Debug

Tomorrow's goal (Friday Oct 12): Whenever a bomb is created give it
a diagonal upwards force in the corresponding direction. Place a 
placeholder enemy in the scene. If a bomb hits either a wall or an
enemy its animation changes to an explosion. 

===
 When firing, bomb is spawned right in front of where the door is
opened

public GameObject Bomb;

Instantiate(Bomb, this.transform.position, Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 90));
