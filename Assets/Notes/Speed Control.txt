Increase enemy speed by 3 or 5 whenever getting a powerup

Increasing the difficulty through powerups increases the chances of
getting more points by defeating multiple enemies at the same time
(multiplier)

This is only applied at the start of a level/game. There's a check that
looks at Robo's powerups and adjusts speed accordingly

speed = speed + (3 * fireLV) + (3 * bombLV);
