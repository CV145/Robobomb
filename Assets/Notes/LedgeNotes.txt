Ledge Climbing (Separate script)

- when Robo has a tile in front of him and there's nothing
above that tile...
 - change animation to legde climbing
 
 void OnCollisionEnter2D (Collision2D other)
{
 if (other.GameObject.name == "ledge")
	{
	debug.log("Impact with ledge");
	change animation
	GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().velocity = new vector2(0,0);
	GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().gravityScale = 0;
	anim.setTrigger("climbnow");

---
To grab a ledge, grounded has to be FALSE and vSpeed LESS THAN 0 (falling)
Player emits two raycasts, one on lower half and one on upper half.
If the lower half is true and the upper half is false...


Else if both are true do nothing.
If both are false do nothing.
If the upper is true but lower is false do nothing.


Vector2 direction is (-1,0) if flipped left, and (1,0) if flipped right


Walls Layer (layer masking)
