Today's Goal (10/19/2018):
 When Robo touches an explosion or an enemy, respawn

The stats script, void OnCollisionEnter2D, if 
collider is an explosion or enemy, set transform position
to start.transform.position

GameObject start = gameObject.find("Start")

////

Make a list of ideas for enemies and mechanics...


Bun-o, every time it touches the ground it waits for a
split second then jumps.


if (Physics2D.OverlapCircle(new Vector2, groundRadius, whatIsGround)
{
Rigidbody.velocity = Vector2.up * jumpForce;
