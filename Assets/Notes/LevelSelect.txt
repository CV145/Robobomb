- Make a new scene called Level Select
- Add this scene to BuildSettings (3)
- When clicking on PLAY in the menu, go to this scene
- This scene has a canvas called Planets
- This canvas has 5 large buttons that will be considered planets

(A canvas is a HUD. The rectangle is a simulation of how it would
look with a camera. The camera is separate from the canvas however. It
cannot be moved and looks like it's locked into place)

Original: 208 x 104
Upscaled: 416 x 208


----------

- If the screen is swiped down, move the canvas down to show the planets
above. If the screen is swiped up, move the canvas up

Have one big Planet Container game object that holds the different 
planets


-------

Clicking on a selection item should quickly scroll to that item's
corresponding page

-------

On clicking a planet, activate another UI that displays on top of the 
panel and scroll snap. This UI has a semi-transparent image color that
darkens the planet behind. With it comes an image that represents the
current area over to the right, and buttons that represent the 
planet's levels
