Separate scripts added to bombup and fireup that, depending on a bool,
move back and forth like the guardbot
- Most things in this game are gonna be moving back and forth

Change the controls so one tap changes direction,
 and a second tap in the same direction makes Robo “kick" and slightly 
budge

(Is there any way I can take my programming classes in uni instead? In

a second tap in the same direction makes Robo “kick" and slightly budge
- if facingRight (and arcade is true), slightly budge
- bomb drop only works if not budging


if (facingRight)
and right is pressed
then budge

if (!facingRight)
and left is pressed
then budge
