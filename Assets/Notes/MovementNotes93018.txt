When left key is pressed, move left
When right key is pressed, move right

- A vector is a line I believe.
- A vector has an x component
- This component is set equal to the direction of the transform 
(positive or negative) times moveSpeed (5) times the amount of time
since the last frame
----
- A rigidbody has a velocity. It can be set to a speed float times
the transform direction (-1 or 1 times 10)
 Issue: Robo tipping and falling over
	- Is rotation on? Freeze rotation on Rigidbody
	- Take rotation off to get that effect again

----------
- How to flip Robo when changing direction?
		- Call on sprite renderer component
-----------
 CALLING AND SWITCHING ANIMATIONS
- Make a condition in the animation controller. If "Speed" is greater than
.01, switch to walking animation

Animator anim;

anim = GetComponent<Animator>()

//Call property from controller

anim.SetFloat("Ex:Speed", MathF.Abs(move)); //check if speed is not 0 (get 
absolute value and set it equal to speed float)
-----------
DIFFERENT KIND OF MOVEMENT

public float maxSpeed = 10.f;
bool facingRight = true;

void Start()
{}

void FixedUpdate()
{
 float move = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal")
 rigidbody2D.velocity = new Vector2(move * maxSpeed, rigidbody2D.velocity.y);
 //set the velocity of player's rigidbody using vector(x,y)

 if (move > 0 && !facingRight)
 {Flip();}
 else if (move < 0 && facingRight)
 {Flip();}
}

void Flip()
{
 facingRight = !facingRight;
Vector3 theScale = transform.localScale;
theScale.x *= -1;
transform.localScale = theScale;
}
