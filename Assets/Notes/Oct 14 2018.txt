Today's Goal: Fix ledge climbing. A single raycast that 
checks only when Robo is falling whether there is a 
grabbable in front. Works because grabbales are manually 
placed in level, so I can rest assured there won't be any 
tiles above.

After that, work on the homework. Finish it. 


Tomorrow's goal 10/15 Monday: Tomorrow I can make the 
powerups. Search up how to do powerups and increase bomb
and fire levels respectively when collecting one. Higher
fire level increases explosion scale, while higher bomb level
increases cap on bombs to throw.

When Robo climbs up, freeze position still for a bit then
resume movement

IEnumerator BriefPause()
{
yield return new WaitForSeconds(1);
}

StartCoroutine("BriefPause");
