Today's Goal: Expand buttons so that there are invisible 
"safe zones" that also trigger mobile touch input.
- Pressing down spawns a bomb drop, an untriggered bomb, 
that explodes in 3 seconds or, when kicked, explodes when
hitting a wall
- Add a mobile button for bomb dropping

=============

- Create new game object called Bomb Drop, duplicate of Bomb
- Pressing down spawns a dud bomb. Almost just a simple 
physics object just that it explodes after 3 seconds

Camera shake when bombs explode?
Camera.main.GetComponent<CameraControl>().Shake(0.5f, 10, 1);
