Today's Goal: Create the guardbot
- GameObject with bright red square as sprite, 16x16
- Script called Guardbot Script. Every frame transform either increases
or decreases depending on starting direction bool.
- Two raycasts, one on the right and one on the left. If either of those
hit do a Flip() to change directions (reverse transform). Just multiply
by -1 whenever this happens (-1 * -1 = 1, 1 * -1 = -1)
- Raycast checks against a layerMask for any solids, grabbables, objects,
or player

Variables 
- FacingRight bool
- LayerMask collidables
- Direction float

Functions
- Flip() multiplies direction by -1
- Update() checks if bool is FacingRight, set transform to
new Vector2 (direction + or - 1, y)

or direction + direction every frame

- Also check if either left or right raycasts are hit then do Flip()
