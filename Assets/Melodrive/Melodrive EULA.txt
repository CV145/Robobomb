General


1. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California without reference to conflicts of laws principles. This Agreement is the entire agreement held between Us and supersedes any other communications or advertising with respect to the Melodrive SDK, Software and Documentation. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The Melodrive SDK, Software and Documentation were developed by private expense and are deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial software documentation”, respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212(b), as applicable. Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performing, displaying or disclosing of the Melodrive SDK, Software and Documentation by the U.S. Government shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by this License. Your use of the Software and Documentation may be governed by laws and regulations of the US, including, without limitation, those issued by the Department of Commerce and the Bureau of Export Administration, and you agree to comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Failure fully to comply with this EULA, and any breach by you will result in automatic termination hereof and Melodrive reserves all rights to all legal and equitable remedies for all damages resulting therefrom.


1. You acknowledge that, in the event you breach any provision of this Agreement, Melodrive will not have an adequate remedy in money or damages. Melodrive shall therefore be entitled to obtain an injunction against such breach from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon request without posting bond. Melodrive's right to obtain injunctive relief shall not limit its right to seek further remedies.


1. No modification of this Agreement shall be binding on Melodrive unless it is in writing and is signed by an authorized representative of Melodrive.
